## About the Project

This project is a code challenge that displays Marvel characters using the Marvel API. It is built with Next.js and demonstrates modern web development practices, including server-side rendering and API integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn, pnpm, or bun) installed on your system.

### Setup

1. Copy the example environment file to create your local environment configuration:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

   The `.env.local` file is used to store environment variables required for the project to run. Update the values in `.env.local` with your Marvel API credentials or other necessary configurations.

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
